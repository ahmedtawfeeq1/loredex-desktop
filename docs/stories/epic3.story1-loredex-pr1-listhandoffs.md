# Story 3.1: loredex PR-1 — listHandoffs (loredex repo)

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** desktop app and CLI,
**I want** a generalized `listHandoffs(scope)` export,
**so that** both surfaces share one handoff collector.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. loredex exports `listHandoffs(scope)` generalizing `collectProductHandoffs` to inbox/outbox/all, per-project and company-wide, returning an exported `HandoffCard[]` type.
2. The CLI's handoff listing is rewired onto the same export with unchanged output.
3. Unit tests in the loredex repo; a release is published and the desktop pin bumped.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Generalize the collector (AC: 1)
  - [x] In the loredex repo: extract/extend `collectProductHandoffs` into `listHandoffs(scope: { direction: 'inbox'|'outbox'|'all'; project?: string })`
  - [x] Define + export `HandoffCard`: id, from/to project, objective, created date, status (open/consumed vocabulary in M1), note path, reading-order refs
  - [x] Company-wide = no `project` filter; per-project = filtered lanes
- [x] CLI rewire (AC: 2)
  - [x] Point the CLI's handoff-listing command at `listHandoffs`; output byte-compatible (snapshot test)
- [x] Release (AC: 3)
  - [x] Unit tests; loredex release; bump the desktop exact pin; replace the `HandoffCard` stub in `loredex-desktop/src/shared/types.ts` with `import type { HandoffCard } from 'loredex'`

## Dev Notes

- **Repo:** sibling `loredex` repo; only the pin bump + stub replacement touch the desktop app.
- `collectProductHandoffs` exists today but is product-scoped — this PR generalizes rather than duplicates (one collector for CLI, MCP, and app; that's the point). [Source: architecture.md#loredex-library-surface]
- `HandoffCard` becomes the payload of the `handoffs.list` channel and of `handoff.new` events — include everything Story 3.2's card UI needs (from/to, objective, age source, status) so the app never re-parses notes for the board. [Source: architecture.md#ipc-contract]
- Status vocabulary in M1 is open/consumed only — do NOT introduce the M2 lifecycle states here; consume attribution fields arrive with PR-2.
- Listing is read-only; no write-lock or schema-stamp concerns in this PR.

### Testing

- loredex repo: fixture vault with handoffs in both directions across ≥2 projects; scope matrix (inbox/outbox/all × project/company); CLI snapshot parity. [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-fable-5 (Claude Code)

### Debug Log References

- loredex repo: `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run lint` clean; `npm test` 115/115 green; `npm run build` OK (commit e9e8601)
- CLI parity verified via inline snapshot test + manual run against the nimbus simulation vault

### Completion Notes List

- `listHandoffs(vaultPath, scope, today?)` added in `loredex/src/core/product.ts`; `HandoffCard extends ProductHandoff` with `id` + `readingOrder` (parsed from the "## Reading order" section). `collectProductHandoffs` is now a thin wrapper over it (one collector).
- CLI `handoffs` listing and MCP `handoffs_open` rewired onto the export; CLI output byte-compatible (path-sorted to match the old walk order; inline-snapshot parity test).
- Exported from `lib.ts`: `listHandoffs`, `HandoffCard`, `HandoffScope`.
- Desktop `HandoffCard` stub replaced with `export type { HandoffCard } from 'loredex'` in `src/shared/types.ts`.
- DEVIATION (sanctioned scope cut): no npm release/pin bump — the desktop uses `"loredex": "file:../loredex"` with dist rebuilt. Release-time TODO: publish loredex and pin the exact version.

### File List

- loredex: src/core/product.ts, src/commands/handoff.ts, src/mcp/server.ts, src/lib.ts, tests/listhandoffs.test.ts (commit e9e8601)
- loredex-desktop: src/shared/types.ts

## QA Results

**Verdict: PASS with concerns** — Evidence base (QA pass 2026-07-10, fresh-eyes BMAD QA agent): app vitest 118/118 (23 files), lib vitest 115/115, `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build` clean, time-boxed `npm run dev` smoke (alive 3+ min, clean exit), and an M1-DoD driver that exercised the core-host modules directly against the real nimbus simulation vault (tree/readNote/resolveLink/search/handoffs/homeBrief/syncStatus/activity).

- AC1: verified — `listHandoffs(scope)` + `HandoffCard` exported; lib tests green; M1 driver listed 8 real handoffs (2 open, 6 consumed) across 4 projects.
- AC2: verified — CLI + MCP rewired; byte-compatible output asserted by inline-snapshot parity test in the lib.
- AC3: **concern** — lib tests pass, but no npm release/pin bump (file: dep, sanctioned); AND `HandoffCard.id` (note basename) is not unique across projects — two open `2026-07-09-handoff-nimbus-backend-2` exist in the real vault (board action item, lib fix needed).
